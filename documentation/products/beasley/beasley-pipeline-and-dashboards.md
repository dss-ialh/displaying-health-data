Hi my name is Will, and I'd like to discuss dashboards and their pipelines

1. Describe what the BBMC does
    1. Coordinate 5+ statisticians on large projects involving transactional data
        1. domain experts in the clinical space
        1. assimilating data sources from multiple agencies
        1. statistical analysis for academic publications
        1. information displays for nontechnical audiences
    1. screenshots of dashboards, covering a large space
        1. CQI for home visiting nurses
        1. training for CBT therapists
        1. CPS worker assignments
        1. patient eligibility for pharmaco study
1. Pipeline
    1. The next hour is primarily about dashboards, but I'd like to spend 5 minutes on the upstream stages, which makes the analysis possible.
    1. This is a simplified pipeline created for this presentation, so I won't be distracted by the cool content of the real projects.  (It also provides a way for the audience to run the code, without exposing PHI.)

1. Fictional Scenario
    1. The pediatrics department has partnered with three county programs to monitor the cognitive trajectories of patients over time.
    1. In the current grant, the nurses create three 6-month mini-research studies.  They develop a manageable change to the services the provide, and see if their mini-intervention improves the services they provide.  One real intervention involved a thorough script of welcoming new clients.  Another real intervention was sending text messages to clients to reduce no-shows.

1. Lessons reinforced
    1. The nurses have incredible ideas for improving services delivered. It's worth our time to facilitate and translate these ideas into interventions that can be evaluated with quantitative evidence.
    1. Even if you "knew" everything you do is superior, implementing the nurses treatment ideas and measurement ideas increases their engagement in the process.  This should improve the services the provide, and the quality of the research.
    1. The effectiveness of the dashboards will improve if the nurses are involved in their development.  They are the audience, after all.
    1. Math phobia is a real thing.  It was a powerful obstacle to the nurses' acceptance of the information display.  Even after you warn your dashboard developers (and the nurses), there will probably be a gap still.
    1. Writing the scribes is difficult (ie, the piece that grooms and reshapes multiple analysis-agnostic data tables into a single analysis-specific rectangle).

1. Lessons learned
    1. Writing the scribes is really difficult, particularly for these monitoring scenarios.  That's another 20 minute talk.
    1. This particular group of nurses preferred a top-down entry into their data.  Most scientists prefer bottom-up.  Here are some examples of how we changed our presentation.
    1. Hovering text provides an alternative entry into understanding the graph.  Showing a textual representation of the coordinates wasn't helpful for some.  The hover text were complete sentences, like "For Tulsa county in 2004, the average cognitive score was 5.5" in spaghetti plots and "" in histograms.
    1. Monthly meetings are not frequent enough at the beginning.
